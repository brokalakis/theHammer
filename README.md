# theHammer
an Arduino game build with Lego blocks, arduino and immagination!

The game is going like that:
The player presses a button and places his finger under the "hummer".
The hummer will fall in a random time, and the player should be quick to remove his finger to avoid being hit!
If the hummer hits the finger three times, then it does a little "dance".

Enjoy!
